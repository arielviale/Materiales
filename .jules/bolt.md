# Bolt's Journal

## 2024-05-22 - Initial Setup
**Learning:** Initialized Bolt's journal.
**Action:** Always check this file for critical learnings before starting.

## 2026-01-17 - CDN Optimization
**Learning:** Using "latest" versions of CDNs (like cdn.tailwindcss.com) causes 302 redirects and prevents immutable caching. Pinning versions + preconnect measurably improves connection setup time.
**Action:** Always pin CDN versions and use preconnect for 3rd party domains.
